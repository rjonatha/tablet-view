                I'm an aspiring technology entrepreneur. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science, Majoring in Information, 
                Focusing on Human-Computer Interaction & Social Media, Minoring in Statistics & Data Science at the University of Michigan--Ann Arbor. 
                I'm skilled in several programming languages, such as Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, R, VB, HTML, and CSS.

                When I was 15, I came alone to the United States for continuing my education from Indonesia. 
                I’ve skipped high school and graduated with 3 degrees (Associate in Science, Associate in Arts, and High School Diploma) when I was 17. 
                There was a time when I challenged myself and took 26 credits in one quarter which was insane! I believe this is something unique and interesting things that I have done in the past. 
                During my experience at Michigan, I’ve designed a mobile social media app and taken an exciting entrepreneurship course. This has been my favorite project and professional endeavor so far!
                <br><br>
                This summer, I interned for a start-up technology company named ALTAVINDO. 
                We were working on a ZOOMIFY project where we created a website and an app to connect consumers with experts based on their interests via zoom. 
                I learned a lot about developing web applications and performing data analysis in this project. As a product development intern, I also did software testing and collected dummy data for improving user experience. 
                Furthermore, I met with a lot of new people and networked with them.
